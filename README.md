# ggrf-api-demo

This repository contains demonstrations of how to use the Rewiring America GGRF HVAC Upgrade API.

Rewiring America provides an API that replicates the methodology GGRF has selected for evaluating the changes in
emissions associated with various household HVAC upgrades.

This API is primarily intended to be used by our various GGRF partners.

More details and the demo code can by found in the Python notebook
[Rewiring GGRF HVAC.ipynb](./Rewiring%20GGRF%20HVAC.ipynb).
